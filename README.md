# Melanoma Detection Assignment
> Creating CNN model which will clasiify images into 9 different cancer types.

##Problem ststement
>To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type
of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer
deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence 
of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Libraries used

* numpy
* keras
* tensoflow

## Conclusions
- Succusfully implemented image dection on cancer types.
